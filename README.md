There are two folders, one is for the linear regression task, the other is for the support vector machine.

Linear Regression

  This folder contains:
  
    The python file with the linear regression model labeled 'AICoursework1LinearRegression.py'.
    
    A folder called 'LinearRegreessionResults' that contains:
    
      A python file that analyses the dataset labeled 'Extragraphs.py'
      
      PNG Images of the results and graphs taken from the python files that can also be found in the report.
      

  SVM

    This folder contains:
      The python file with the support vector machine model labeled 'AICoursework2SVM.py'
      
      A folder called 'SVMResults' that contains:
      
        A python file that analyses the dataset laveled 'Extrastats.py'
        
        PNG Images of the results and graphs taken from the python files that can also be found in the report.
